# Numeric-Matrix-Processor

### Objectives
The objective of this project was to build a Python program that presented the user with options to peform several matrix operations. The operations that this program allows are:
- Addition of two matrices
- Multiplication of a matrix by a constant
- Multiplication of two matrices
- Transposition of matrices
  - Main diagonal transpose
  - Side diagonal transpose
  - Vertical line transpose
  - Horizontal line transope
- Determinant of a matrix
- Inverse of a matrix

The user was presented with these options at the start of the program, and was able to select from any one of these options. Once the selected operation was performed, and the user was provided with the output, the program presented the options again to them till the user decided to exit the program.

### Key concepts learnt in Project
- Doing this project improved my understanding of arrays (lists) in Python. Each operation involved heavy use of nested lists.
- I learned about using Recursion for the finding the determinant and inverse of a matrix
- Classes and Methods: Haflway through doing the program, I refactored it to create a Matrix class with each operation (including creating a matrix) was a method of the Matrix class.
